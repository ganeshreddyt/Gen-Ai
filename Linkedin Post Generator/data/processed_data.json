The event, a joint initiative supported by Elipses and the Riba Free Foundation , brings together Muslim CEOs and Founders to share business insights and experience, guided by faith. 34 founders and CEOs were in attendance last night. Here are the key themes of the evening that resonated with me were: \ud83d\udcb0 Riba: there was a strong Islamic finance attendance and it was a universal view that businesses should be built free of riba if we are to solve the world's problems in a meaningful way. Moreover financial services has a duty to provide non riba based solutions to the wider economy. \ud83e\udd1d Community: Almost everyone had a story about finding their tribe within the Muslim community after being disillusioned in their career or gaining a wealth of support from their community when starting out and seeking advice. Lots of great connections made to further bring together our community last night, Alhumdullilah. \u2764\ufe0f The Giving Economy: Charity is the beating heart of the Muslim community. Muslims donate 4x more than non Muslims to charity in the UK. Our guest speaker, Nobel prize nominee Dr. Amjad Saqib , founder of Akhuwat is a living embodiment of building business with impact and that the responsibility lies with all of us to give back in any way we can during our careers. As always thanks to my co-organiser Omar Khaliel without whose tireless efforts these events couldn't come together and to his team at RFF. This was our last event of the year. We'll be back in January with our next event in Birmingham (which I'm reliably told will be epic - no pressure Zhagum Arshad ).

Relax your body. Take a deep breath. And ask yourself \u2013 WHAT WENT WELL? Give yourself some space to really soak in the good. Just to be clear: this is NOT about avoiding or disregarding challenges. There's a LOT that's difficult right now \u2013 for everyone \u2013 both personally and professionally. This practice is about resourcing yourself. It's about creating space to allow the things that ARE going well to shift to the foreground, so that they can support you in effectively taking on the challenges ahead. You can carve out 60 seconds for this or invite your whole team to join you in making space to soak in the good. Ending the week focusing on your wins (big or small) boosts morale, counterbalances the brain\u2019s negativity bias, and invites a sense of ease and accomplishment going into the weekend. #pauseatwork #mindfulnessatwork #mindfulleadership #resilienceatwork #resilience",

This city, and the vision behind it, is nothing short of extraordinary. New friendships, inspiring conversations, and a global network of changemakers, it really felt like stepping into the future. Here\u2019s what struck me most, their ability to dream without limits. Anything they can imagine, they seem to build. For someone like me, who\u2019s always worked within tight, riba-free budgets and self-funded ventures, this level of ambition realisation is awe-inspiring. A few standout places: Education City They didn\u2019t just send students abroad, they brought entire universities to Qatar. American institutions with world-class faculty housed in state-of-the-art facilities. Learning spaces so beautiful, they make you want to stay forever. Minaretein Centre A stunning fusion of purpose\u2014half mosque, half university. It\u2019s a space for education, spirituality, and growth. Hosting global speakers, workshops, and lectures, it\u2019s a perfect model of what learning and faith combined can achieve. Qatar National Library An architectural masterpiece. Event spaces, exhibitions, caf\u00e9s, and workspaces all rolled into one. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen in the UK, a hub for ideas and innovation. Al-Mujadilah Center and Mosque for Women A dedicated space for women, empowering discussions, workshops, and personal development. A true testament to fostering progress through inclusivity. Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP) AI, advanced research, and cutting-edge innovation, QSTP is where the future is being built. Outdoor lecture theatres, exhibition spaces, and global events set the stage for trailblazing developments. Qatar has done all this in just 20 years. Let that sink in. They\u2019ve taken their energy revenues and invested in people, ideas, and an equitable future for humanity. They are building a nation that incubates venture builders, dreamers, and change-makers. This isn\u2019t just progress it\u2019s perhaps what leadership for the benefit of your people looks like. Qatar really is one to watch, and I can\u2019t wait to see what the next 20 years bring. Grateful to all the amazing folks at Qatar Foundation for the hospitality, brotherhood, and vision we experienced during the GMW Network Summit leaving me inspired.

As the agriculture industry explores ways to accelerate technology adoption we must put farmers at the center of the conversation and really understand their needs and priorities. In this article, we share insights from a survey of 1,000 US farmers that reveal key motivators behind their technology purchase decisions. We used BCG's proprietary Demand Centric Growth approach - which is often applied in Consumer Products - to get a nuanced understanding of what farmers really need. What we see is a clear need to understand not only functional needs - such as reliability and ROI - but also emotional needs - such as helping farmers feel in control, and to feel like good stewards of the soil. By applying new lenses to existing challenges, we can find innovative approaches and meaningful opportunities.

Most people who knew me then would have probably described me as outgoing, easygoing, carefree, always smiling. But inside? I was suffocating with anxiety. Every interaction felt like a minefield of self-doubt. The game-changer? Learning to pause and observe my thoughts without judgment. I realized my anxiety wasn't a life sentence \u2013 it was a pattern I could change. Not everyone battles social anxiety, but we all have our struggles. Maybe it's imposter syndrome, perfectionism, or difficulty setting boundaries. Whatever your challenge, this journey from inner turmoil to emotional intelligence is possible for all of us. It's not about eliminating stress or 'fixing' ourselves. It's about AWARENESS. And training our minds to see what's actually happening (internally and externally) instead of the habitual stories we tell ourselves. Most of all, it's about self-compassion \u2013 treating ourselves with the same kindness we'd offer a friend or colleague. By learning to pause and observe our thoughts and feelings with openness, we can break free from patterns that hold us back. Imagine leading your team not just with strategic brilliance but with emotional mastery. That's the kind of leadership that transforms organizations from the inside out. Ready to take the first step? Try this: Next time you feel overwhelmed, pause for 60 seconds. \u2022 Take some conscious deep breaths to find some sense of grounding. \u2022 Next, observe your thoughts without trying to change them. \u2022 Label them in your mind \u2013 planning, worrying, judging, problem-solving, self-criticizing, comparing, doubting, anticipating, etc. You might be surprised by the clarity that emerges.

Qatar is making bold moves to position itself as a global hub for tech innovation. From robotics to HealthTech and governance, the focus on applied AI is unmatched. The energy and enthusiasm for what\u2019s next in tech is tangible\u2014something I haven\u2019t felt in the UK for a long time. What really stood out? The intentionality. Qatar is putting its money where its mouth is: - Cutting government red tape to make life easier for startups. - Building state-of-the-art venues and infrastructure. - Committing significant investment to incubate talent from all corners of the world. And let\u2019s not ignore the lifestyle factors. With low crime rates, great weather, modern facilities, and a safe environment, Qatar is becoming an attractive destination for the world\u2019s top talent. The Middle East isn\u2019t just catching up anymore it\u2019s pulling ahead! This leaves me with one key concern for the UK. While we\u2019re caught up in bureaucracy and navigating endless hurdles for startups, regions like Qatar are rolling out the red carpet for innovators. They\u2019ve got the funding, the vision, and the willingness to make things happen. The competition for talent is going global, and the UK risks being left behind unless we act now to foster a more supportive and enabling environment for startups. The future is being built. The question is\u2014will we be part of it, or left watching from the sidelines? #AIInnovation #Qatar #StartupCulture #FutureOfTech",

I was able to make a meaningful connection with the panel of speakers and look forward on collaborating with them in the future. Thank you Robert (Bob) Giacalone , Stephanie S. , William Chittenden, Ph.D. , and Elissa Underwood Marek . and of course Wendi J. Fitch Rios and Diego E Vacaflores",
